== Description ==
 
Add a simple slider to your site using the following shortcode [slider fade="true" infinite="true" speed="300" nav="dots" autoplay="false"] (this example shows the defaults, and if using defaults you do not need to use the attribute). Options for nav are dots, arrows or numbers. Speed is in m/s and the others are either true or false.

= Shortcode Attributes =
fade = "true" (allows you to fade in/out the slide changes or have them slide right to left if false)
infinite = "true" (allows you to have the slide loop through all slides, set to false and the user will have to scroll previous at end of slides, or next at start)
speed = "300" (this is the slide speed in m/s so 1000 is 1 second)
nav="dots" (this is the slide navigation, you can choose between dots, arrows or numbers)
autoplay="false" (this allows the slides to automativally slide without needing interaction)
